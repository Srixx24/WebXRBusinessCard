## This is my take on a project requiring my class to create a reimagined version of our business cards hosted through WebXR, thus creating an innovative and engaging way to present my professional information. Through this journey, I learned much about developing web-based AR and VR experiences using WebXR, three.js, and A-Frame. 

<br>
<h3 align="center">The Journey</h3>

To start I wanted to build on what I already knew about ARCore in Unity and started researching WebXR from there. Thankfully with my prior experience, it gave me a solid place to work from. Initially, I had planned to build exclusively in three.js but after further research I found it might be difficult to build for iOS. A suggestion from my instruction sent me searching in the direction of A-Frame and that is what my project is mostly built in. 

A-Frame is an open-source web framework built on top of Three.js, using it as its rendering engine while working in a more user-friendly environment. A-Frame does typically focus more on VR development the AR which made the requirements of this project a little more difficult at first. However, I knew from the start that I wanted to allow my creative side to shine in this project. I wanted to develop not only the required web-based AR experience but also a second VR experience tied to it. Doing this was the biggest challenge of this project, as the two a-scenes did not want to play nice together until the last minute.
